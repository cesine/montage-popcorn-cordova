MontageJS applications are client-side applications with no particular back-end dependency.\n* Node.js and npm. MontageJS uses Node.js and npm for its developer tools and for code dependency management.\n* Cloned GitHub repo of this demo.\n\nFirst, if you haven't done so already, [download](http://nodejs.org/download/) and run the prebuilt Node.js installer for your platform from the Node.js website to install npm.\n\nThen, to run the Popcorn demo locally, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the popcorn [GitHub repo](https://github.com/montagejs/popcorn) in your desktop.\n\n2. Use your command line tool to navigate to the cloned directory and install the modules required to run the demo:\n        \n   ```\n   cd popcorn\n   npm update\n   ```\n    \n3. Spin up your preferred HTTP server and point your browser to the associated port.\n\n    > During development MontageJS applications rely on XHR to load their various components and modules, which is why you will need a web server to serve the demo.\n\n    > If you happen to have [minit](https://github.com/montagejs/minit), the Montage Initializer, installed (`npm install minit -g`) you can run `minit serve` from within the demo directory to set up a server on demand.\n\n\n## Application Structure\n\nFolder / File | Description |\n------------ | ------------- \nassets | Contains global styles and images for the application.\nmodel | Contains the data model.\nindex.html | Is the entry-point HTML document.\nLICENSE.md | Contains copyright information.\npackage.json | Describes your app and its dependencies.\nREADME.md | Provides information about the demo application and how to install it.\nui | Contains the user interface components of the demo application.\n\n## Contact Us\n\nGot questions?
